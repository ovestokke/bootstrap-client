# Windows Applications List - FULL (DEPRECATED)
#
# ⚠️ This file is deprecated as of v2.0!
# 
# The FULL mode now uses multiple app list files:
#   - Apps-List-Basic.txt
#   - Apps-List-Gaming.txt
#   - Apps-List-Developer.txt
#   - Apps-List-Productivity.txt
#
# Setup-System.ps1 now offers 5 modes:
#   [1] Skip       - No apps
#   [2] Basic      - Essential apps only
#   [3] Gaming     - Basic + Gaming
#   [4] Developer  - Basic + Developer
#   [5] Full       - Basic + Gaming + Developer + Productivity
#
# This file is kept for backwards compatibility but is not used by the new scripts.
# Please use the new app list files instead.
